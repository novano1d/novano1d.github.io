STATUS: 0200 HOURS 1/22/2072
Contact was made with HQ only a few days ago.
However HQ has been affected by the recent viral outbreak on Earth.
As always... HQ is on my mind. In my thoughts. Always hoping for the best.
Waiting... always waiting. For my next talk with HQ. It's not often that the coms are working perfectly.

Sometimes I gaze from our little base on the moon back down on that planet we called home for so long.
I think about how small it looks from here. How small it really is in the scheme of things.
Yet it's the most significant insignificant thing in the whole of reality.
